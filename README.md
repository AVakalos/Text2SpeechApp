# Text2SpeechApp

Text2Speech is a simple app with graphical user interface developed in Java which transforms input text to speech with some extra features such as configuring the sound parameters (volume, pitch, etc) and encoding the input text with a cryptographic algorithm. All the components of the app are tested with JUnit test cases.
